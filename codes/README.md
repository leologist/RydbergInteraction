# RydbergInteraction

This is a MATLAB library used to compute interaction energy of pairs of atoms in Rydberg levels.
Rydberg levels are atomic levels with high principal quantum number (n = 30~150).

Current capability is limited to Rubidium atoms.


# Usage
The main function to run is pair_interaction.m

Some examples on how to use the code are in the demo_XXX.m scripts
